## Coding Challenge New Cashier

This Repo is about another coding challenge that is about changing a menu, which comes in as a string without spaces or capital letters. You need to separate the words and then capitalized them, as well as have them in order as they appear on the menu below. It is a kyu 6.


Some new cashiers started to work at your restaurant.
They are good at taking orders, but they don't know how to capitalize words, or use a space bar!
All the orders they create look something like this:

*"milkshakepizzachickenfriescokeburgerpizzasandwichmilkshakepizza"

The kitchen staff are threatening to quit, because of how difficult it is to read the orders.
Their preference is to get the orders as a nice clean string with spaces and capitals like so:
"Burger Fries Chicken Pizza Pizza Pizza Sandwich Milkshake Milkshake Coke"
The kitchen staff expect the items to be in the same order as they appear in the menu.
The menu items are fairly simple, there is no overlap in the names of the items:

## Menu Items:

1. Burger
2. Fries
3. Chicken
4. Pizza
5. Sandwich
6. Onionrings
7. Milkshake
8. Coke


## Additionally

I ended up splitting the string by letter and then iterating over each letter until I found a word that matched a word in the menu. I then appended each word that I found to a new list, which I could reorganize according to the menu again. While I struggled with the first part it was really the second part that gave me the most difficulty.

Thank you to Codewars for helping me practice my Python skills.
